<p>Welcome the The first Irrlicht Engine SDK release. This is an alpha version 
  of the SDK. So please note that there are features missing in the engine and 
  maybe also some bugs.</p>

<h2><a name="1"></a>1. Where to find what<br>
</h2>
<p> You will find some directories after decompressing the archive in which came 
  the SDK. These are:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" width="500">
  <tr>
    <td>\bin</td>
    <td>The compiled library Irrlicht.DLL and some compiled demo and example applications, 
      just start them to see the Irrlicht Engine in action.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\doc</td>
    <td>Documentation of the Irrlicht Engine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\examples</td>
    <td>Examples and tutorials showing how to use the engine. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\include</td>
    <td>Header files to include when using the engine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\lib</td>
    <td>Lib to link with your programs when using the engine.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\media</td>
    <td>Graphics and sound data for the demo applications and examples.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>\source</td>
    <td>The source code of the Irrlicht Engine. This code is not needed to develop 
      applications with the engine, but it is included to let you be able to recompile 
      and debug it, if necessary. </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p></p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="2"></a>2. How to start<br>
</h2>
<p>To see the engine in action, just go to the \bin directory, and start some 
  applications. There should also be an application named TechDemo.exe, this should 
  show the most interesting things.<br>
  <br>
  To start developing own applications and games with the engine take a look at 
  the 1.HelloWorld example in the \examples directory.<br>
  There will also be a .html file with an easy to understand tutorial.<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="3"></a>4. Release Notes</h2>
<p>This is an alpha version of the SDK. So please note that there are features 
  missing in the engine and maybe also some bugs. The following list is a complete 
  list of parts of this alpha SDK which do not work 100% correct. All other parts 
  which can be found in the documentation and accessed with the Irrlicht header 
  files work and can already be used. </p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
  <tr> 
    <td>OpenGL Device</td>
    <td>The OpenGL Device is currently only able to load textures and draw basic 
      3D primitives. No 2D functions, complex materials and dynamic light are 
      implemented. Please use the DirectX8 or the Software Device instead. In 
      the next release (0.2) the OpenGL device will be complete.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Software Device</td>
    <td>Dynamic lighting, multitexturing, 3d clipping and bilinear filtering are 
      not implemented because the Software Device was intented to to only 2d functions, 
      the primitive 3d functions are only an addition. Until the first non beta 
      release (1.0) of the Engine, some more 3d functionality will be added.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>BspTree</td>
    <td>The binary space partition scene node does not work correctly and has 
      some bugs in it, which might lead to crashes. Please use the OctTree scene 
      node instead. There is nearly no difference between the interface of them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>MeshViewerGUIElement</td>
    <td>The camera control of this element is currently disabled.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>FileOpenDialog</td>
    <td>Not all functions are implemented.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Render to Texture support</td>
    <td>Is not implemented yet. All devices will ignore a setRenderTarget() call. 
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>MS3D Skeletal Animation</td>
    <td>A loaded mesh is currently not animated and only drawn static.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>Quake 3 maps</td>
    <td>No support for curved surfaces and scripted materials yet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Linux Support</td>
    <td>The engine currently only runs with Windows platforms. A linux version 
      will be available somewhere between the versions 0.4 and 0.5, it depends 
      on the need of the users. Please contact me, if you would like to have a 
      linux version earlier.</td>
